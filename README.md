### User Experience Report:
- The main part of user testing that was performed was for key config. We experimented with various control schemes, and got feedback on which layouts were particularly easy or hard to use, both from crossplay sessions and playtesting with friends. In the end, we settled with using a control scheme that was familiar to as many people as possible. This meant using arrow keys for movement, space for jump, z/x/c for other actions.
- Another part of improving user experience was to improve instant feedback. Through crossplay sessions, we received a lot of feedback that it was hard to tell when the player took damage, as well as keeping track of hp. To address this, we made two changes. One change was to change the hp interface to use a hp bar instead of just numbers. The other change was to add an animation to the player when damage is taken.
- The final part of improving user experience was to add a tutorial. Aside from being unfamiliar with the control scheme, it was clear that our game had many different buttons for different actions, which was overwhelming when reading the help menu. To address this, we first changed the help menu to take out many of the (unnecessary) details and focused on the core controls. Then, we also added a comprehensive tutorial level to get the player used to the controls of the game before going into the main game.
