Ideas for Gameplay
 - 427 class will have short attention span
     - Show the cool parts of our game right away
         - Make the player choose a mutation at the start of a run
         - Show screen that says "generating level..." or something. Spelunky shows: "walls are shifting..."
 - Toggle infinite health during demo so that Zoom players can finish the game without failing
 - Health is a currency -> I can lose X health to gain something
 - Some player mutations or abilities should be those of enemies
 - Jumping on enemy just bounces off -> doesn't kill enemy like in Super Mario Bros
 - Maybe beating the game unlocks more difficult runs
 - collect ingredients while playing - bring ingredients to an alchemist - if u have the right ingredients for a given mutation you can craft it and gain the mutation - archaic ingredient names like oil of vitriol, wolfsbane, water essence

Ideas for Mutations
 - Max Health up + DMG up
 - Attack Speed up
 - Damage down + Attack Speed way up
 - x99 bombs or item
 - Faster projectiles
 - Gain an extra jump and X
 - Gain a short ground dash
 - Gain a celeste style omni-directional dash
 - Shoot a homing missile at a nearby enemy every x seconds
 - Gain an extra jump and +x% movement speed
 - homing missiles have burning/fire effect
 - every 5th attack freezes the enemy
 - Attack 10x faster but do 10x less damage
 - homing missiles do 3x dmg to frozen or burning enemies





Gameplay
    Combat
     - Fight monsters with melee or ranged attacks.
     - Simple combat mechanics which are modified by the mutations.
     - Mutations will increase stats like ATTACK DAMAGE or HEALTH. Mutations can also change the way you fight (e.g. a mutation might give you a ranged attack).
    Exploration
     - Each level is randomly generated. The player must explore the level to find treasures, fight monsters for EXP, and buy mutations at shops. 
     - The player will WANT to fully explore the level before progressing to the next level because their character becomes stronger the more EXP and mutations they gain.
    Progression
     - Player character gains EXP from killing monsters
     - Player character picks a mutation from 3 randomly chosen mutations when they level up
     - Player finds gold from treasure chests or by killing monsters. Gold can be spent at shops.
    Bossfight
     - At the end of each chapter (aiming for 2 for now), there is a boss fight. 
     - Bosses are scripted events.
    Content
     - The game is divided up into biomes (chapters) and stages. There are three stages/levels in each chapter. At the end of each chapter, there is a boss fight. For the playable game, we should aim for 2 biomes. This is 6 levels to complete in a run. For the final game, we may aim for 3 biomes/chapters.
